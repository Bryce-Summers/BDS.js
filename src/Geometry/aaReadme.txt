# 2D - 3D Geometry Classess.

This folder contains objects that are not made for a specific dimension.
Points work just as well in 2D and 3D, Boxes and rays work as well.
Curves depend solely on points.

Objects like polylines are made for 2D queries such as mouse inclusion and are optimized as such.

Objects such as meshes and triangles are designed for 3D applications.
